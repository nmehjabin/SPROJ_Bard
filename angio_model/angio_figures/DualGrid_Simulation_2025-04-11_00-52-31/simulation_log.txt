Corrected forward-biased neighbors dx==0: [(23, 22), (24, 22), (24, 23), (22, 23), (22, 22)]
Valid neighbors after grid boundary check: [(23, 22), (24, 22), (24, 23), (22, 23), (22, 22)]
Tip (ID: 5) at (23, 23) grew to (22, 23) with VEGF value: 0.5360680129921573
Tip positions after growth:
  Vessel ID 1: position (8, 27), VEGF value: 0.5040
  Vessel ID 2: position (38, 28), VEGF value: 0.2867
  Vessel ID 3: position (17, 8), VEGF value: 0.5083
  Vessel ID 4: position (20, 30), VEGF value: 0.5367
  Vessel ID 5: position (22, 23), VEGF value: 0.5093
