Step 1: Anastomosis check phase
Starting anastomosis check...
in ananst func 0 (4, 2)
checking if one tip cell is near another tip
Anastomosis detected between tips at (4, 2) and (3, 2)
Tip at (4, 2) has collided with existing vasculature
in ananst func 1 (1, 3)
checking if one tip cell is near another tip
in ananst func 2 (3, 2)
checking if one tip cell is near another tip
Anastomosis detected between tips at (3, 2) and (4, 2)
Tip at (3, 2) has collided with existing vasculature
Updated vasculature positions: [(4, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2)]
